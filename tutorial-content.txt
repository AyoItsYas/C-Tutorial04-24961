Questions,
    1) What is wrong with the  following if statement (there are at  least 3 errors). The Indentation
    indicates the desired behavior.

        if numNeighbors >= 3 || numNeighbors = 4
            ++numNeighbors;
            printf("You are dead! \n " );
        else
            --numNeighbors;

    2) Describe the output produced by this poorly indented program segment:

        int number = 4;
        double alpha = -1.0;
        if (number > 0)
        if (alpha > 0)
            printf("Here I am! \n" );
        else
            printf("No, I’m here! \n");
            printf(“No, actually, I’m here! \n");

    3)  Consider the following if statement, where doesSignificantWork, makesBreakthrough,
    and nobelPrizeCandidate are all boolean variables:

        if (doesSignificantWork) {
        if (makesBreakthrough)
        nobelPrizeCandidate = true;
        else
        nobelPrizeCandidate = false;
        }
        else if (!doesSignificantWork)
        nobelPrizeCandidate = false;

    4)  Write if statements to do the following:
        – If character variable taxCode is ’T’, increase price by adding the taxRate percentage of price to it.
        – If integer variable opCode has the value 1, read in double values for X and Y and calculate and print
        their sum.
        – If integer variable currentNumber is odd, change its value so that it is now 3 times currentNumber
        plus  1,  otherwise  change  its  value  so  that  it  is  now  half  of  currentNumber  (rounded  down  when
        currentNumber is odd).
        – Assign true to the boolean variable leapYear if the integer variable year is a leap year. (A leap year is
        a multiple of 4, and if it is a multiple of 100, it must also be a multiple of 400.)
        – Assign a value to double variable cost depending on the value of integer variable distance as follows:

        Distance          Cost
        -----------------------------------   ----------
        0 through 100     5.00
        More than 100 but not more than 500  8.00
        More than 500 but less than 1,000  10.00
        1,000 or more     12.00

        1. The if statement is missing the parenthesis around the condition.
        2. The conditional is using the assignment operator instead of the equality operator.
        3. The else statement is missing the curly braces.

        1. The if statement is missing the curly braces.
        2. The else statement is missing the curly braces.
        3. The printf statement is using the wrong quotation marks.
